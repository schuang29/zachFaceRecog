# Zach's log

Latest code (3rd experiment) is in steve_webcam_detect_recog.py. This will do the face recognition. To run, in VSC terminal window, run python steve_webcam_detect_recog.py. You can easily do that by right-clicking on the file, and choose the Run Python File in Terminal option.

Prior to face recog, it was simply detecting faces using the webcam (2nd experiment). You can run the steve_webcam_detect.py script, similarly by right clicking on the file in VSC and Run Python File in Terminal option.

The first experiment was to recognize faces from pictures. This can be cound on face_detect.py. To run, run this from terminal: python face_detect.py family3.jpg

Update: Now supports OpenCV3. This change has been made by furetosan ( https://github.com/furetosan) and tested on Linux.

To run the OpenCV3 version, run facedetect_cv3.py.
